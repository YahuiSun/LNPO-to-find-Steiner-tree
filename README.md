# LNPO-to-find-Steiner-tree

This repository contains MATLAB coding of the LNPO algorithm, which is used to find heuristic solutions to Node-Weighted Steiner Tree Problem.

For details of LNPO algorithm, please look at "Sun, Y., Halgamuge, S.: Fast algorithms inspired by physarum polycephalum for node weighted steiner tree problem with multiple terminals. In: IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC), pp. 3254-3260 (2016)"

Run LNPO.m to start the program.
